v1.02
=====

- Error messaging
  of the following formats for the initial command character (Note that the
  ASCII character will be printed if it's printable):

  ERROR: command invalid: z\n
  ERROR: command invalid: unprintable ASCII code: 32\n'


v1.01
=====

- False start detection:
  If a racer completes 4 ticks (i.e. 4 roller revolutions) before the countdown
  reaches 0, the output is
  FS:i\n
  where i is the 0,1,2,3 corresponding to the racer number who did the false
  start, and \n is the newline character.  Countdown and racing does not stop.
  It's up to the race display software to react to the false starts and stop the
  race if desired.

- Time trials:
  This is a simple change. Whereas before when all 4 racers reach the distance
  of the race, the updates automatically stop, in this version, progress updates
  continue indefinitely until the software sends the 's' command to stop the
  race. The race display software can then watch for the timestamp corresponding
  to the number of ms in the time trial and have a record of the distance
  traveled in ticks for each racer.

- cleaned up the way race distance is being set.
  It should be backwards compatible. Whereas before a carriage return character
  was required to follow the two characters representing the distance, now all
  newline and carriage return characters sent through the input are ignored.
